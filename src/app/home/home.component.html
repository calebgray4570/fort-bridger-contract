      <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span><strong><em>Many questions are circling around about the 2020 rendezvous.   The board wishes we could give you all a firm answer.  As of right now the board is still preparing for the rendezvous, but with that said we are currently waiting to hear back from the county health department and the state of Wyoming to find out if the rendezvous can go on and if so what precautions we will need to take.  We are hoping for an answer by the July 11th  general membership meeting.   We encourage all members to attend  to this meeting.  Please continue to check the Fort Bridger Rendezvous website and Facebook page for updates.   The board will let you know as soon as we know anything. </em></strong></span></h4>
